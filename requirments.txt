# Minimal runtime requirements for the current Omega AI CLI application
# The current `src/` code uses only the Python standard library, so there
# are no mandatory third-party packages required. Keep this file to document
# optional dependencies you may want to install later.

# Optional extras (uncomment to use)
# If you plan to run transformer models locally, uncomment the following
# and pin versions appropriate for your environment. These libraries are
# large and may require CUDA/compatible hardware for best performance.
# transformers>=4.40.0,<5.0.0
# torch>=2.0.0,<3.0.0
#
# Common data and web libraries (only if you need them)
# numpy>=1.25.0
# pandas>=2.2.0
# flask>=2.3.0

# To install only the optional extras you need, create and activate a venv,
# then run, for example:
#   pip install "transformers>=4.40.0,<5.0.0" "torch>=2.0.0,<3.0.0"

# When you've installed packages, freeze a lockfile for reproducibility:
#   pip freeze > requirements.lock.txt
